-Files generated:
  -cleaned_Pizza_Sale.xlsx
  -cleaned_Pizza_ingredients.xlsx
-Result: 
  - Cleaned Sales Records: 48,580
  - Cleaned Ingredient Records: 514

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Report
--Visualizations produced:
  - Daily sales trend plot
  - Monthly sales bar chart
  - Top 10 best-selling pizzas bar chart
  - Sales quantity distribution histogram
  - Correlation heatmap
  - Missing values heatmap
--Key findings: 
  - Sales show clear seasonality and daily trends.
  - Certain pizzas are consistently top sellers.
  - Data is mostly complete after cleaning.

 3.Predictive Model with Code and Evaluation Metrics
--Model used: 
   ARIMA(1,1,1)
--Evaluation metric:
   MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error):16.00%
--Forecast plot:
  Saved as arima_sales_forecast.png
--Code: 
  - Included in your datacleaning.py and above.

4. Detailed Purchase Order for the Next Week
--Files generated:
  purchase_order_next_week.xlsx
--Sample output:
  ```
     pizza_ingredients  quantity_needed_grams
  0           Cheese                12345.0
  1     Tomato Sauce                 6789.0
  ...
  ```
5. How it was calculated: 
  - Used ARIMA to forecast total sales for the next 7 days.
  - Estimated pizza type proportions from historical data.
  - Multiplied predicted pizzas by ingredient requirements.

PROJECT REPORT (Summary)
-- Introduction:
  Forecasting pizza sales and automating ingredient purchase orders to optimize inventory and reduce waste.
-- Methodology:
  Data cleaning, EDA, ARIMA modeling, forecast-based purchase order generation.
-- Findings:
  - Data is clean and robust for modeling.
  - ARIMA provides reasonable forecasts (MAPE â‰ˆ 16%).
  - Automated purchase order aligns ingredient needs with predicted demand.
-- Business Implications:
  - Improved inventory planning.
  - Reduced overstock and waste.
  - Data-driven procurement decisions.
-- Recommendations:  
  - Integrate holiday/promotion effects for even better forecasts.
  - Regularly retrain models with new data.
